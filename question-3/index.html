      <p>The <i>Mangalyaan</i> mission, also known as the <b>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)</b>, was a remarkable
        achievement by the
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and a historic milestone in space exploration. Launched on <b>November
          5, 2013</b>, Mangalyaan was Indiaâ€™s first interplanetary mission, making India the <b>first Asian country</b>
        and the
        <b>fourth space agency</b> in the world to reach Mars, following the Soviet Union, NASA, and the European Space
        Agency.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
      The primary goal of the Mangalyaan mission was to develop the technology necessary for interplanetary space
      exploration. Specifically, the mission aimed to:
      <p>
        - Study Marsâ€™ surface features, morphology, and mineralogy. <br>

        - Analyze the Martian atmosphere, particularly focusing on methane levels to assess the planetâ€™s potential
        for supporting life. <br>
        - Test key spacecraft systems such as orbit maneuvers, deep-space communication, and autonomy in operations.
      </p>
      <h3>Achievements and Impact</h3>
      Mangalyaan successfully entered Mars' orbit on <b>September 24, 2014</b>, in its very first attempt, a feat that
      not many space agencies have accomplished. One of its most notable successes was achieving this at a <b>budget of
        just $74 million</b>, making it one of the most cost-effective missions to Mars ever. This budget-friendly
      success
      showcased ISRO's ability to perform high-quality space exploration with limited resources. <br>

      The spacecraft provided crucial data on the Martian surface, weather patterns, and atmosphere, contributing to
      the global understanding of Mars. Additionally, the mission inspired generations in India and around the world,
      significantly raising the country's profile in space exploration. <br>

      In conclusion, ISROâ€™s Mangalyaan mission was a monumental success that not only advanced scientific knowledge
      about Mars but also demonstrated Indiaâ€™s capabilities in space technology and innovation on a global stage. <br>
